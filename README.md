## Description

**Project domain:** social-networking app

**Brief high-level description:**
We have a map, where people will have an opportunity to share offline events. 
Basic use case looks this way: if a person wants to find some members, he/she can do it by adding the event on the map (click the place on the map and input time). If a person wants to attend some event (for example I want to play volleyball on these weekends), he/she just has to open the map and to choose among the available options.

**List of any technical problems blocking progress:**
- interactive map embedding in Java
